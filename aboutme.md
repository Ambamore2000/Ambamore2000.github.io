title: ABOUT ME
subtitle: Some information about myself.
---

My name is Andrew Kim. Currently I am a student at the University of the Pacific as a freshman.
My ultimate goal with computer science is to work with Simulations and Artificial Inteligence.
However, here are some goals I plan to achieve in chronological order:
- Build a portfolio for myself.
- Get an internship through the University of the Pacific CO-OP Program.
- Graduate with a Bachelors degree.
- Continue school to obtain a Masters degree.

## Inspiration
So, this is just a little fun fact about me. I became passionate about Computer Science as a kid while I wasn't able to understand much. When I was younger, I was invested in a game everyone probably knows about: Minecraft. It was an interesting game for me when I was exposed to the server development. As a 12 year old kid, I tried running my own prison server (A prison server is a type of game mode). Advertising a server for free during this time would bring at an average 30 new players every day to your server. It was a great experience for me to have, running servers along with other people to make money off of other kids. But my childish behaviors kicked in and I blew all the money on stupid shit. While hosting low-quality servers, I thought about how I could learn to create my own features in the game. This is when I started learning Java. As a 12 year old. What a joke honestly. I started by developing for other people, and labeled myself as a "Freelance Developer" once I knew I could profit off of it. But this is when I became open to Object Orientated Programming. Since then, I've always seen everything in this world as Objects with functions like anything in this world. This is really the main reason why I want to work with simulations. It's a thought I can't even explain to myself, but it's a passion I know I have. And with Aritifical Inteligence popping off in this new digital era, it's a very interesting idea I'd like to dive into one day.
